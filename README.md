<p>As if it needs to be said--Dick's Cybernetics is completely fictional.</p> 
<p>Don't worry, color choices will be changed eventually.</p>
<p>Images are from <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance<em>, co-developed by Platinum Games and Kojima Productions, and published by Konami Digital Entertainment. <br>The image use is for entertainment purposes only.</p>
